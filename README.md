retrofit-spotify
================

Basic example that uses the retrofit project to interact with the spotify api to get albums for a particular artist.

It demonstrates the following features:
* Automatic [de]serialisation
* Path variable binding
* Generic binding types (i.e. Paged<Album[]>
* Immutable types (i.e. Paged, Album)
* API specifications as Java interfaces (i.e. SpotifyService)
